The Reddit mods can not be trusted. Your "typical vendor" (yes, the one you are thinking of) is reputable and not a scammer, but you do <em>not</em>
want to buy from him. <br/>
                Want to know why?<br/>
                Check this out:
            </p>


            <ul class="reasons">
                <li>The dude is a fucking fine arts collector and trader</li>
                <li>Yes, like actually</li>
                <li>The dude pays off r/Juul mods so he can discreetly promote his own shit, while banning everyone else</li>
                <li>This is stopping the people who have Mango to sell for $40 from selling it to you</li>
            </ul>


            <p>
You're probably thinking, "so what", right? Just a guy trying to make some change and block his competition? Wrong.<br/>
                It's fucking you over.<br/>
                I'm a dude who's passionate about those old flavors just like you are. Why else would I set up a site like this?<br/>
                The problem is, people are looking to sell them, people are looking to buy them, and you can't, because this "typical vendor" is running a monopoly.<br/>
                When you can't buy what you're looking for at a reasonable price, you're getting raked. He might be "selling" out of stock Mango pods for 55 dollars (anyone who has been around remembers when he sold them for $150), but you're not getting them.<br/>
                Would you like to know why?<br/>
                It's because he's buddies with A list celebrities (including the royal family) and exports his shit to Qatar. That's not a joke.<br/>
                Remember how PPNY was tacitly allowed on the subreddit before they went out of business? Take a wild guess on whose hands were in whose pockets.<br/>
                I know how ridiculous this sounds, but all of it is true. Dude's public company valuation is at half a million dollars. LOL.<br/><br/>
                Let me spell something crazy out for a moment. I make your favorite Mango, Mint, Creme Brulee, Cucumber, etc. liquid, brand new and fresh, unoxidized. Exactly the way you remember it 7 years ago.<br/>
                You know what most people who want to buy it can't do?<br/>
                Buy it.<br/>
                They're stuck chiefing some shitty ass chungus that's 7 years old and has no flavor and paying exorbitant prices, because he sets the market price. They have no idea other sellers exist. Fuck that.<br/>
                Yeah, we sell shit. I'm not here to racketeer or monopolize. Buy from whomever or sell to whomever you like, I don't care.<br/>
                I just don't like seeing people as passionate as myself be raked/taken advantage of.<br/>

                That aside, here's some links if you don't want your pockets raked/want to buy from some shady corpo.<br/>
                If you're just some guy looking to sell (like everyone else), reach out and we'll add you to the list.<br/>
